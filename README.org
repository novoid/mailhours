* mailhours (shell script)

mailhours: no querystring found, displaying helpscreen

syntax:  mailhours QUERYSTRING [DIRECTORY] [DESCRIPTION]

mailhours searches for emails in ~/home/USER/Maildir/.tmp/cur~ or
[DIRECTORY] with QUERYSTRING in the From-lines.

A graph will be generated that shows at what hours the correspondent
emails from this querystring were sent.

Then you know when this person is typically sending email answers.

Configuration is done in the files:
:   ./mailhours
                  ... general defaults
:   /home/USER/.config/mailhoursrc
                  ... to override general defaults

examples:
:     mailhours Torvalds
         ... generates a graph when Linux Torvalds
             sends emails in my DEFAULTDIR folder
:     mailhours Gates ~/Maildir/.spam/cur
         ... generates a graph when Bill Gates
             sends his emails that are stored in
             the folder ~/Maildir/.spam/cur

** Why

People tend to answer emails following a certain pattern. One person
might answer emails after lunch, others do it in the morning. 

If you want to visualize the pattern of a person, you can use emails
send by her/his using this script.

** Configuration file example

A ~/.config/mailhoursrc file might look like this:

: ## ===================================================
: ## purpose: analyze emails of communications partners
: ##          to know, at what hours they usually send 
: ##          their emails
: ## author:  Karl Voit <shellscript@Karl-Voit.at>
: ## see scriptfile vkmailhours (in your path) for details
: ## ===================================================
: 
: ## view the result with this command
: VIEWPROGRAM=xview
: 
: ## if par2 is missing, this is the default Maildir directory
: DEFAULTDIR="${HOME}/Maildir/.tmp/cur"
: 
: ## end config
